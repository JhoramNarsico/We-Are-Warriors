## Getting Started

To run this game locally, you need a local web server and optionally a Firebase project for the online features.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Local Web Server:** You need a way to serve the files over HTTP. Simple options include:
    *   Node.js with `http-server`: `npm install -g http-server`
    *   Python's built-in server: `python -m http.server` (Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2)
    *   VS Code Live Server extension.
2.  **Firebase Project (Optional):** If you want to use the Login/Leaderboard features:
    *   Create a project at [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable Email/Password Authentication in the Authentication section.
    *   Create a Firestore database in the Firestore section. Set up basic security rules (e.g., allow reads publicly, writes only for authenticated users to the leaderboard).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Firebase Configuration (Optional):**
    *   If using Firebase, go to your Firebase project settings -> General tab -> Your apps -> Web app.
    *   Find your Firebase configuration object (it looks like `firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "...", ... }`).
    *   Open the `auth.js` file in the project.
    *   **Replace** the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object within `auth.js` with your actual Firebase project configuration.
    ```javascript
    // --- START OF FILE auth.js ---
    (function() {
        const Auth = {};

        // --- PASTE YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG HERE ---
        const firebaseConfig = {
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Replace
            authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN", // Replace
            projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", // Replace
            storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET", // Replace
            messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID", // Replace
            appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", // Replace
            measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional, replace if you use Analytics
        };
        // ... rest of auth.js
    ```

### Running the Game

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.
2.  **Start your local web server:**
    *   Using `http-server`:
        ```bash
        http-server
        ```
    *   Using Python 3:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
3.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

## Gameplay

1.  **Tutorial/Login:** On first launch (or after reset/refresh), you'll see a tutorial explaining the basics. The last slide includes optional Login/Sign Up forms. You can also load a previously saved local game from here if one exists.
2.  **Unit Selection:** Choose a unit type from the left sidebar using the buttons or number keys (1-4). Knight (4) must be unlocked in the shop first. Unit stats are displayed below the buttons.
3.  **Spawning:** Click the "Spawn Unit" button or press `Spacebar` to deploy the selected unit from your base. This costs Gold (ðŸ’°).
4.  **Starting Waves:** Click the "Fight!" button to begin the enemy wave. Enemies spawn from the right.
5.  **Combat:** Your units automatically move towards and attack the nearest enemy or the enemy base.
6.  **Resources:** Earn Gold (ðŸ’°) passively during waves and for kills. Earn Diamonds (ðŸ’Ž) for kills and completing waves.
7.  **Shop:** Use Diamonds (ðŸ’Ž) in the Shop (right sidebar, toggle with button) to buy permanent upgrades for your base and units.
8.  **Winning a Wave:** Destroy the enemy's red base to clear the wave, earn rewards, and prepare for the next.
9.  **Winning the Game:** Survive all 20 waves.
10. **Losing:** If your blue base's health drops to zero, the game is over.
